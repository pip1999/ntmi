    "    \n",
    "As we began discussing in [T1](../T1/T1.ipynb), a language model (LM) is a **probability distribution over text**, where text is a finite sequences of words. \n",
    "    \n",
    "LMs can be used to generate text as well as to quantify a degree of naturalness (or rather, a degree of resemblance to training data) which is useful for example to compare and rank alternative pieces of text in terms of fluency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To design an LM, we need to talk about units of text (e.g., documents, paragraphs, sentences) as outcomes of a random experiment, and for that we need *random variables*. If you need a recap on probability theory, don't miss out [our refresher](../R1/R1.ipynb).\n",
    "    \n",
    "We will generally refer to the unit of text as a *sentence*, but that's just for convenience, you could design an LM over documents and very little, if anything, would change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **random sentence** is a finite sequence of tokens in the vocabulary of a given language. As a running example, we will refer to this language as English. The vocabulary of English will be denoted by $\\Sigma$, a finite collection of unique tokens (which, as we discussed in T1, may include words, punctuation, special symbols, etc). We will denote a random sentence by $S$, or more explicitly, by the random sequence $X_{1:m} = \\langle X_1, \\ldots, X_m \\rangle$. Here $m$ indicates the sequence length. Each token in the sequence is a random variable that takes on values in $\\mathcal X$, an enumeration of $\\Sigma$. We will adopt an important convention, every sentence is a finite sequence that ends with a special symbol, the end-of-sequence (EOS) symbol. Clearly, random sentences take on values in the set $\\Sigma^*$ of all strings made of symbols in $\\Sigma$, which is a set that does include an infinte number of valid English sentences (possibly not all English sentences, as our vocabulary may not be complete enough, but hopefully this space is still large enough for the LM to be useful) as well as an infinite number of sequences that are not valid English sentences.       \n",
    "    \n",
    "Part of the deal with a language model is to define and estimate a probability distribution that expresses a preference for sentences that are more likely to be accepted as English sentences. In practice an LM will prefer sentences that reproduce statistics of the observations used to estimate its parameters, whether these sentences will resemble English sentences or not will depend on how expressive the LM is, that is, whether or not the LM can capture patterns as complex as those arising from well-formed English (or whatever variant/register of English was observed during training).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Notation guide** Some textbooks or papers use $X_1^m$ instead of $X_{1:m}$ for ordered sequences, both are clear enough, but we will use the notation adopted by the textbook, that is, $X_{1:m}$. The textbook uses $X_1\\cdots X_m$ (without commas) as another notation for ordered sequences, but we prefer to explicitly mark the sequence with angle brackets to avoid ambiguities, i.e., we prefer $\\langle X_1, \\ldots, X_m \\rangle$. The textbook is not very formal with respect to probability distribution notation, we prefer to be more formal about it, so we will subscript $P$ with the random variable(s) of interest, e.g., $P_{X_1:m}$ for a distribution over sequences, or $P_X$ for a distribution over words, or $P_{X|H}$ for a conditional distribution."
